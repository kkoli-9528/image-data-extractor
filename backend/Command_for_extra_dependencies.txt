Before Installing PyTorch, TorchVision, and TorchAudio from the PyTorch CUDA 12.6 index:

 Install Flask and python-doctr from PyPI:

**
 pip install flask python-doctr
**

Only use the below command if you have GPU with CUDA-Enabled, and check the official doc of the nvidia about CUDA for more info (https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-microsoft-windows/index.html)

**
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu126
**

OR

use the below command if you don't have GPU with CUDA-Enabled and want's to use CPU:

**
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
**

Note: I have not used the command for CPU, I don't know the results. Cheers mate!!!
